Lesson 1: Basic Electronics Knowledge
==================================

- What voltage, current, and resistance mean
a. VOLTAGE 
    Symbol: V   Unit: volts 
    
    Electrical pressure that pushes electric current through a circle.
    The potential energy difference between two points in a circuit
    
    Analogy: Water pressure in a pipe.

    Formula (Ohm's Law): Voltage = Current Ã— Resistance

    Types of Voltage:
        a. Direct Current (DC) Voltage
            Constant polarity (+ -) -> Stay fixed.
            Ex:
                Batteries:      AA, Li-ion, 18650
                USB power:      5V DC
                Solar Panels    with charge controllers

        b. Alternating Current (AC) Voltage
            Polarity reverses periodically (50Hz or 60H) 
            Ex:
                Household Outlets (110V AC or 220V AC)
                Power Grids

b. CURRENT 


c. RESISTANCE
