Lesson 1: Basic Electronics Knowledge
==================================

- What voltage, current, and resistance mean
a. VOLTAGE 
    Symbol: V   Unit: volts 
    
    Electrical pressure that pushes electric current through a circle.
    The potential energy difference between two points in a circuit
    
    Analogy: Water pressure in a pipe.

    Formula (Ohm's Law): Voltage = Current × Resistance

    Types of Voltage:
        a. Direct Current (DC) Voltage
            Constant polarity (+ -) -> Stay fixed.
            Ex:
                Batteries:      AA, Li-ion, 18650
                USB power:      5V DC
                Solar Panels    with charge controllers

        b. Alternating Current (AC) Voltage
            Polarity reverses periodically (50Hz or 60H) 
            Ex:
                Household Outlets (110V AC or 220V AC)
                Power Grids
    
    How Voltage Works in Circuits:
        1. Voltage Source:      Battery                                         -> Creates a potential difference
        2. Electrons flow:      from negative(-) to positive(+) terminals       
        3. Components:          LED                                             -> Consume voltage to operate
        Ex:
            A 3V battery lights an LED because the LED "drops" ~2V (the rest is lost as heat)

                Why not use exact 2V Battery to light up a 2V LED?
                    Problem 1:      No "headroom" for resistance. If the battery is exactly 2V, and the LED drops 2V, 
                                    there’s no voltage left for a current-limiting resistor.

                    Result:         The LED may not light up or will behave unpredictably.

                    Problem 2:      As the battery drains, its voltage drops below 2V, and the LED stops working entirely.

                    Problem 3:      Inefficient power transfer. A 3V battery + resistor delivers stable current 
                                    even as the battery drains from 3.3V → 2.7V. A 2V battery would cut out abruptly 
                                    when it dips below the LED’s forward voltage (V_f).
    
    Measuring Voltage:
        Tool:       Multimeter      Mode: Voltmeter
        Method:
            1. Set multimeter to DC or AC
            2. Connection:      Red probe        -> positive
                                Black probe      -> negative
            3. Read display
    
    Common Voltage Levels:
        Voltage         Typical Use Case 
        1.2V            NiMH rechargeable batteries.
        3.3V            ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO.
        5V              Arduino, USB power.
        12V             Car batteries, PC fans.
        24V             Industrial sensors, 3D printers.
        120V/230V       Household AC power.
    
    Voltage in Microcontrollers (ESP32, Arduino)
        ESP32:
            Operating Voltage:      3.3V (GPIO pins).
            Input Voltage:          5V (via USB) or 3.7V–12V (via VIN pin).

        Arduino Uno:
            Operating Voltage:      5V (GPIO pins).
            Input Voltage:          7V–12V (recommended).

        Warning: Exceeding voltage limits can fry components. Always check datasheets.

    Safety Tips
        * DC Voltage ≤ 48V is generally safe for beginners.
        * AC Voltage (120V/230V) can be lethal—use caution!
        * Capacitors can store voltage even when off—discharge them safely.
