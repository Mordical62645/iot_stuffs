Lesson 1: Basic Electronics Knowledge
==================================

You don't need to be an electrical engineer â€” just the basics:

- What voltage, current, and resistance mean
- How a LED, resistor, push button, and sensor works
- Understanding GPIO (general purpose input/output)
- How to read simple wiring diagrams (schematics)

ðŸ’¡ If you know how to wire a button to blink an LED, you're set.

Required Topics:
----------------
- Voltage, Current, Resistance (Ohm's Law)
- Digital vs. Analog Signals
- GPIO Pins (Input/Output, PWM, ADC)
- Common Components (LEDs, resistors, buttons, sensors)

ðŸ“Œ If you're new:
- Try a beginner Arduino kit (e.g., Elegoo Uno Starter Kit)
- Learn from All About Circuits
